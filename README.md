# Description of the project 
For our final project during Complexity Garage course we decided to make an alarm clock. In order to switch it off it's necessary to light a photoresistor (or cover it if the light's already turned on in a room) placed in the chimney. The shape of the alarm clock resembles a garage to match the name of the course - "Complexity Garage". There also are buttons, which allow a user to change both current and alarm time.  
# Science and tech used 
The case was 3D printed and placed on a styrofoam base. The current time and time of an alarm are displayed on an lcd screen. A photoresistor placed in the chimney serves as a switch. An rtc module keeps track of the time.
